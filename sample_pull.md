# Whats pull requests?

If other people want to contribute to you project
- they will fork you repo
- they will create a new branch and work on bugfix/ feature
- and then inorder to merge they make pull request to your repo
- Since they dont have direct permissions to merge on your repo
- And you can compare their code and if you like you can merge that pull request
